		about:  "Face of Man is a collaboration between Alejandro Silva, Jesse Chevan, and Evan Johnson. They joined the Mr. Records family in 2017 for their second LP, <em>Bouquet</em>. For their sophomore release Face of Man continues its project of pop maximalism - high life guitar layered over the subs and crackles of modern pop production, R&B vocal flights nestled into modular art rock structures - and plaintive, midwestern candor. Thematically, the LP explores female relationships and their variagated forms: the familial, the lustful, and the romantic. <em>Bouquet</em>, despite it's meloncholy, lifts the listener with lush, contrasting colors and an impression of gradual unfolding.",

		name : 'CR‑39',
		imageFile : 'cr.jpg',
		about: "Alternately described as \"Mallwave\" and \"Consumercore\", CR‑39 makes music for the American retail nostalgist. The project of Chris Lynch, he describes idling through Kmart's rows with his mother as a child, wide-eyed in those endless fonts of merchandise, passively absorbing the hushed drum of corporate music. It was these and other reminiscences of big-box Suburbia that birthed CR‑39 and its sonic template. In <em>Gold Trim</em>, CR‑39's debut EP for Mr. Records, Lynch wants listeners to experience the music not as songs necessarily, but as individual, flashbulb memories of purchasing an item on-sale; or that more modern feeling when a favorite TV series becomes, suddenly, available on a streaming service. <em>Gold Trim</em> packages and preserves the spirit of these older, physical retail spaces for the modern listener.",
