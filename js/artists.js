		about:  "Face of Man is a project of Alejandro Silva and his long time collaborator Jesse Chevan. They joined the Mr. Records family in 2017 as they searched for a home for their second LP <em>Bouquet</em>, recorded with the addition Evan Johnson (vocals, keyboards). In it Face of Man continues its project of pop maximalism - hear layering, high life inspired guitar against the subs and crackles of modern pop production - and explores the theme of female relationships and their variagated forms: the familial - a dying mother (\"Lavender\") and an unknown grandmother (\"Sola\"); the lustful - sex as a salve for anxiety (\"Take Me to the Place\") and the women to whom you are attracted despite yourself (\"Cast Her Gait\"); and the romantic - building strength through partnership (\"Easy Kill\", \"Her Vernacular\"). <em>Bouquet</em>, despite it's meloncholy, lifts the listener with lush, contrasting colors and an impression of gradual unfolding.",

		about: "Alternately described as \"Mallwave\" and \"Consumercore\", CR‑39 makes music for the American retail nostalgist. The project of Chris Lynch, he describes idling through Kmart's rows with his mother as a child, wide-eyed in those endless fonts of merchandise, passively absorbing the hushed drum of corporate music. It was these and other reminiscences of big-box Suburbia that birthed CR‑39 and its sonic template. Lynch's desire is for the listener to experience his music not as songs necessarily, but as individual, flashbulb memories of purchasing an item on-sale; or that more modern feeling of when a favorite TV series becomes, suddenly, available on a streaming service. CR‑39's debut EP for Mr. Records, <em>Gold Trim</em>, packages and preserves the spirit of these older, physical retail spaces for the modern listener.",
