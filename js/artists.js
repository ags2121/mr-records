		name: 'Face of Man',
		imageFile : 'fom.png',
		about:  "Face of Man is a collaboration between Alejandro Silva, Jesse Chevan, and Evan Johnson. They joined the Mr. Records family in 2017 for their second LP, <em>Bouquet</em>. For their sophomore release Face of Man continues its project of pop maximalism - high life guitar layered over the subs and crackles of modern pop production, R&B vocal flights nestled into modular art rock structures - and plaintive, midwestern candor. Thematically, the LP explores female relationships and their variagated forms: the familial, the lustful, and the romantic. <em>Bouquet</em>, despite it's meloncholy, lifts the listener with lush, contrasting colors and an impression of gradual unfolding.",

		name : 'CR‑39',
		imageFile : 'cr.jpg',
		about: "Alternately described as \"Mallwave\" and \"Consumercore\", CR‑39 makes music for the American retail nostalgist. The project of Chris Lynch, he describes idling through Kmart's rows with his mother as a child, wide-eyed at endless fonts of merchandise, passively absorbing the hushed drum of corporate music; these and other reminiscences of big-box Suburbia birthed the CR‑39 sonic template. In <em>Gold Trim</em>, CR‑39's debut EP for Mr. Records, Lynch wants listeners to experience the music not as songs necessarily, but as flashbulb memories of buying an on-sale item; or that more modern feeling of a favorite TV series becoming, suddenly, available on your streaming service. <em>Gold Trim</em> packages and preserves the spirit of these older, physical retail spaces for the modern listener.",

		name : 'Willem Porcelain',
		imageFile : 'wp.png',
		about: "Willem Porcelain makes music for the contemporary worker: sturdy, energizing, and marching precariously into the future. Porcelain came to Mr. Records with an aesthetic that grew together over the many vacant moments in this professional life. As a remote, traveling IT worker, Porcelain spent many hours on his laptop, attending to his far-flung clients with the esoteric network specifications that were his specialty. And while his total IT work hours were long, they were rarely contiguous, and his days could be filled equally with hours where his work was music. In <em>Cratersoft</em>, Willem's first EP for MRR, you can hear the mind of its creator in this state, darting between contexts, as if exchanging desktop panes or rearranging browser windows.",

		name : 'Living Situ',
		imageFile : 'ls.jpg',
		about: "As a man of leisure, most things in life came easy to Living Situ. The owner of a popular restaurant/entertainment venue, a business heavily delegated and optimized, his time was largely unencumbered by material exigencies. His few responsibilities centered around satisfying his business’s need to provide new experiences for their clientele, and so he was always abroad, collecting and reporting back cultural dispatches. Mr. Records first heard from Living Situ after his extended stays in Oaxaca City, Niigata, and the Isle of Man; he was now, perhaps finally, in Phuket and had, unsurprisingly, been up to something unrelated to business. His music turned into the MRR EP <em>Invitation to Phuket</em>, a globetrotting evocation of endless journies.",
